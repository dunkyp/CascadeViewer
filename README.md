CascadeViewer
=============

Cascade VTK Viewer provides a simple viewer over OpenCASCADE taking advantage of VTK for graphical presentation as
OpenCASCADES visual options are frankly baffling. This project will see intermitent updates as it is the basis for 
the presentation in my Academic work. If you want any help with it or have feature requests feel free to ask.

What this is Not
================
This is not a program designed to allow for modelling, my work is focused on the analysis of mechanical shapes so
modelling isn't useful for me and let's face it, there are better systems than OpenCASCADE.

Requirements
=============

VTK, QT and OpenCASCADE
